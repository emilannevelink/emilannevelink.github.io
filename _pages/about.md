Welcome to my academic website! Please take some time to look through my publications, talks, or courses I have taught. Or, download my [CV](http://emilannevelink.github.io/files/cv_emilannevelink.pdf).

What am I up to?
======
I am currently a post-doc at Carnegie Mellon University in [Professor Viswanathan's group](https://www.cmu.edu/me/venkatgroup/). My time is split between research in machine learning interatomic potentials and differentiable molecular dynamics and project management of a DARPA program called MINT. View our team webpage [here](https://www.cmu.edu/energy/rectify/).
My research into machine learning interatomic potentials has spanned investigating adding long-range electrostatic interactions to developing new uncertainty quantification methods and benchmarking them for use in active learning workflows.
My research into differentiable molecular dynamics has focused on implementing forward-mode sensitivity evaluation of trajectory-based observables with emphasis on developing 2NN-MEAM interatomic potentials for all-solid-state batteries.


About this site
======
This site is powered by the  [academic pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), a free service in which websites are built and hosted from a GitHub repository. The site is based on athe [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) template created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
