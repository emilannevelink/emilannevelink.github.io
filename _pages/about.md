Welcome to my academic website! Please take some time to look through my publications, talks, or courses I have taught. Or, download my [CV](http://emilannevelink.github.io/files/cv_emilannevelink.pdf)

What am I up to?
======
I am currently a post-doc at Carnegie Mellon University in [Professor Viswanathan's group](https://www.cmu.edu/me/venkatgroup/). My time is split between research in machine learning interatomic potentials and differentiable molecular dynamics and project management of a DARPA program called MINT. View our team webpage [here](https://www.cmu.edu/energy/rectify/)!
My research into machine learning interatomic potentials has spanned investigating adding long-range electrostatic interactions to developing new uncertainty quantification methods and benchmarking them for use in active learning workflows.
My research into differentiable molecular dynamics has focused on implementing forward-mode sensitivity evaluation of trajectory-based observables with emphasis on developing 2NN-MEAM interatomic potentials for all-solid-state batteries.


academicpages is a ready-to-fork GitHub Pages template for academic personal websites
======
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
